# Create a website using HTML & Bootstrap  

Before we get into things, here are some links to resources you might use during 
your web development:  
- https://getbootstrap.com/
- https://www.w3schools.com/

You'll also need a text editor like Visual Studio Code (which I use), Notepad++, 
or Sublime.  

## Background: What are HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap?  

**HTML** is what holds the content of the page, like text, photos, and links.  
**CSS** is what styles the content of the page so that it's structured nicely and has colors and other decorations.  
**Bootstrap** is a framework that simplifies coding a website by providing tools for
structuring the site more easily, and automatically adjusts your page for different browser sizes 
(don't you hate when a website loads weird on your desktop vs your phone?).  

Think of it like this: HTML is the blueprint of your rooms and furniture, CSS is the interior 
designer who places everything properly and decorates, and Bootstrap is a carpenter 
who helps make building simpler by providing pre-built arches, doors, etc.  

To make a page, technically only HTML is needed, but CSS is always included since it would look 
like a page from the 90's otherwise. Additionally, Bootstrap is totally optional, but it makes 
building a website much easier -- especially because it automatically adjusts for different 
screen sizes.
